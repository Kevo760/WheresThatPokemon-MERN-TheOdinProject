## Overview

### The challenge

- Build photo tagging app
- User will make selections for each character and they will be given feedback on whether they are correct or not
- User clicks the photo, it should place a targeting box around the portion of the photo the user has clicked. That box should contain a list of possible characters
- Provide the user with appropriate feedback (e.g. if wrong, an error message)
- Keep track of how long it takes from when the photo is first loaded to when the user finally identifies all of the characters. It is advisable to do this on the server side

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Bootstrap
- React
- ExpressJS
- Styled Components



### What I learned
This was a refresher on going back to react and using express together. I had an old project that used firebase and use that as a skeleton. Having to work on this project allowed me to gain the confidence on creating a MERN stack.
